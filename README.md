   ```

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Supported Models

### OpenAI
- **GPT-4.1** - Latest flagship with 1M token context, superior coding and reasoning
- **GPT-4.1 Mini** - Beats GPT-4o performance with 83% cost reduction and half the latency
- **GPT-4o** - Multimodal model supporting text, audio, image, and video inputs
- **GPT-4o Mini** - Cost-effective alternative to GPT-3.5 Turbo with better performance

### Anthropic Claude
- **Claude Opus 4.1** - Latest flagship model, most powerful for complex reasoning and coding
- **Claude Sonnet 4** - Advanced model with superior coding and reasoning capabilities
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet** - Hybrid reasoning model with rapid and thoughtful response modes
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku** - Fast and cost-effective model for interactive applications

### Google Gemini
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** - Latest flagship model with adaptive thinking capabilities
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash** - High-performance model with improved agentic tool use
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite** - Fast, cost-effective model for high-throughput applications

## Development

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deployment Options

### Option 1: Server Deployment (Recommended)
Deploy to platforms that support Next.js API routes:

**Vercel (Easiest):**
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy automatically

**Other platforms:** Railway, Render, AWS Amplify, Netlify

### Option 2: Static Export (Limited - No AI functionality)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Static export doesn't support API routes, so AI chat features won't work.

```bash
npm run export
# Upload out/ directory to S3 + CloudFront
```

For AWS S3 + CloudFront with full functionality, you'll need to replace API routes with AWS Lambda functions.
